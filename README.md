# CS-Net: Channel and Spatial Attention Network for Curvilinear Structure Segmentation

This repo is the official implementation of [CS-Net: Channel and Spatial Attention Network for Curvilinear Structure Segmentation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-32239-7_80).

## Note:

The attention module was implemented based on [DANet](https://github.com/junfu1115/DANet). The difference between the proposed module and the original block is that  we added a new $1\times 3$ and $3 \times 1$ kernel convolution layer into spatial attention module. Plese refer to the paper for details.
